# TODO: Create GUI as described
# Large window, mainly text area
# Exit, minimize buttons?
# 'Train Model' Button to take the input text and add it to the markov model
# popup close to cursor placement to show 0-5?  next-word predictions
# Save button to save the input text to a file

# Possible ideas:
# 1.
# On space (new word) run new prediction, update predictions as new letters are being added to current word
#   EX:   Given 'final ' --> prediction 'project'
#         Then the letter r is given: 'final r' --> prediction changes to 'final r<esult>' giving 'final result'
#
# 2.
# If I have time, use tab to autocomplete the prediction. else we can just click the dropdown option
